## linking

To link to this library:

    "de.sciss" %% "desktop" % v

Furthermore, if you want to support a particular platform, also add some of the following:

    "de.sciss" %% "desktop-mac" % v
    "de.sciss" %% "desktop-linux" % v

The current version `v` is `"0.10.7"`.

## building

Desktop currently builds against Scala 2.13, 2.12, using sbt. The last version to support Scala 2.11 was 0.10.4.
To build sub project `"desktop-mac"`, you need either OS X with Apple's EAWT extensions, or otherwise the
dummy [OrangeExtensions](http://ymasory.github.io/OrangeExtensions/) are used.

Note that as of 0.10.5, you need Java 9 or newer to compile; however the library can still be used on
Java 8. Java 9 is needed to compile support for Java 9 `java.awt.Desktop` API.

Some demos are available through `sbt desktop/test:run`. For Mac specific demos, `sbt desktop-mac/test:run`.
Note that when you run on JDK 11 on macOS, it will use the Java 9 API instead of EAWT.
